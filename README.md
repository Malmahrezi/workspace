Hi!

Welcome to Malmahrezi's CS50 Final Project - "Computer Science Exploration Survey Questions!"

"Computer Science Exploration Survey Questions!" is a web page that asks people who are interested in computer science, questions to explore their interest area in the field, also this survey focuses on finding their strenth and weakneses. The Importance of this survey is to guide those new people to the field of computer science so they can pick the right root to reach their destination. As we all know that computer science today has so many different areas whereas each area has its specifications and unique skills to learn. For example, machine learning requires very deep understanding of mathematics, so for those who are planning to study this field, prepare strong mathematic background. This survey can be used by many different organizations for different purposes, schools, web site, educational material provider etc. 

First part of the survey asks about their personal information, name, email and age. Which is important to compare the result and see how the age is directly related to those people strength in term the speed they need to learn each skill.

Then the first quistion 'What computer science career you are interested in?' Which has a Drop down list contains career options, so they can pick one, I have implemented a markdown so when they press on the downward arrow, the list open with 5 careers and one other option for (other)

Then, they will have the next quistion ask about their specilization prefrences, which uses “radio” type of presenting three specialization options so they only can pick one, whenever try to pick another one, the previous disappear.

then the next quistion 'What is the best way of learning for you?' Which does have another drop down list that contains options of ways of learning so they pick whatever they think is the best.
Finally where they are asked to choose whatever subject of computer science that are hard on their opinion(they can pick more than one), where I have used “checkbox” type where they are all appear and you can pick more than one, I have maximize the size of those boxes so they appear clear and easy to use, also you can pick and unpick all of them.

I have used a CSS file with all specification I needed to be represented on my html file, which consist with all sizes and color of the texts and background of the survey, overall, I did my best to make the survey look simple and easy to follow to make enjoyable for the users.

I hope my survey page help those who are interested on applying it to their applications and web pages so they can gather good and precise statistics and give some professional responses to the users about their best plans for their journey. Also this can be used by computer science college new students to perfectly pick classes for their computer science degrees.
This is all about my webpage, hope you enjoy taking the survey!
