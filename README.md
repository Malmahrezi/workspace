"Computer Science Exploration Survey Questions!" is a web page that asks people who are interested in computer science, questions to explore their interest area in the field, also this survey focuses on finding their strenth and weakneses.

First part of the survey asks about their personal information, name, email and age.

Then the first quistion 'What computer science career you are interested in?' Which has a Drop down list contains career options, so they can pick one.

Then, they will have the next quistion ask about their specilization prefrences.
